                and the provincial governments, whereas the federal government mostly assists in curriculum development,
                accreditation and the financing of research and development. Article 25-A of the Constitution of
                Pakistan obligates the state to provide free and compulsory quality education to children of the age
                group 5 to 16 years. "The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age
                of five to sixteen years in such a manner as may be determined by law".[3]</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Most of Master's degree programs require two years education. Master of
                Philosophy (MPhil) is available in most of the subjects and can be undertaken after doing Masters.
                Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) education is available in selected areas and is usually pursued after earning
                a MPhil degree. Students pursuing MPhil or PhD degrees must choose a specific field and a university
                that is doing research work in that field. MPhil and PhD education in Pakistan requires a minimum of two
                years of study.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Out of the formal system, the public sectors runs numerous schools and
                training centres, most being vocational-oriented. Among those institutions can be found vocational
                schools, technical training centres and agriculture and vocational training centres. An apprenticeship
                system is also framed by the state of Pakistan.
                Informal education is also important in Pakistan and regroups mostly school-leavers and low-skilled
                individuals, who are trained under the supervision of a senior craftsman.[20] Few institutes are run by
                corporates to train university students eligible for jobs and provide experience during education
                fulfilling a gap between university and industry for example: Appxone Private Limited is training
                Engineers with professional development on major subjects of Electronics and Computer science and other
                fields.</p>
